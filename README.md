# ðŸ“Š Power BI Portfolio â€“ Julieta Blanco Rivas

Welcome to my Power BI portfolio!  
I'm a Reporting & BI Analyst passionate about building data-driven solutions for global operations.

This repository contains a curated selection of dashboards Iâ€™ve developed and automated for top-tier international clients, including PayPal, eBay, Lexmark, Twilio, and DiDi, as part of my work at Foundever.

Each report was designed to uncover insights, monitor KPIs, and optimize decision-making in dynamic, high-scale environments.
